There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

            Any arbitration will occur in the County of New Castle, Delaware although you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence.  Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“</span><span className='terms-description-bold-500'>JAMS Rules</span><span className='opacity-65'>”), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

            As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.  The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.  The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute.  For any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250), and Ora will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.  For any arbitration initiated by Ora, Ora will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
